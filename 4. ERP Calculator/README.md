# ERP Calculator

Using JavaScript and HTML, I create a simple calculator for finding the current equity risk premium--the premium investors should demand for investing in equities above the risk free rate.

I focus on current and forward price-earnings multiples for these calculations. You can find a good source for such data from data aggregators like FactSet, Bloomberg, or [the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/stocks/peyields).
