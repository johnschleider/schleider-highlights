# Attributes of Monopolistic REITs

How much pricing power do REITs have, and what gives a REIT monopoly power? I analyzed monopolism in 153 real estate investment trusts and found the following:


1.	REITs are about twice as monopolistic as the average nonfinancial firm.
2.	Monopolism varies greatly by REIT vertical, with Specialty REITs having the most market power and Office REITs having the least.
3.	Occupancy relates positively with REIT monopoly power—more fully occupied REITs do indeed earn higher monopoly profits.
4.	REIT Sunbelt exposure and monopoly power have an interesting relationship through time. In the 2010s up to 2022, Sunbelt REITs had stronger pricing power, but in 2023 Sunbelt REITs operate in a much more competitive environment versus those of other regions.
5.	COVID significantly impacted REIT monopolism. As a whole, REITs lost monopoly power. Retail and Healthcare verticals lost the most power. Office monopoly power remained relatively constant (and negative) before and after COVID, indicating this vertical was excessively competitive even before COVID’s office occupancy effects.
6.	REIT monopolism is not as persistent through time as that of nonfinancial corporations—both on the industry level and the firm level. In other words, REITs have a tougher time keeping their monopoly power. This might be a result of the industry’s inelastic supply, which can lead to large swings in monopoly profits.
7.	Unlike nonfinancial corporations, REIT monopoly power might not be useful in predicting future risk-adjusted stock market returns.


The goal with this analysis is to provide quantitative insights into asset-level real estate trends. Many of the results confirm what CRE commentators have already suggested, while others (like the pre- and post-COVID REIT vertical effects) raise new questions.
