A highlight of my personal and school computer science / data science projects

## My projects

### 1. Monpoly Power (Honors Thesis)

I am currently completing an honors thesis at Washington and Lee University exploring the relationship between a companies risk profiles and monopoly power. This project involved a large panel dataset from the Wharton Research database, coding my own applications for calculating a firm's risk, and extensive econometrics and data visualization. I find that some commonly used measures of monopoly power disagree with each other in a way that is not well explained by current theory. In addition, I further the research on the murky relationship between risk and monopolism. 

### 2. Comparative Advantage

Any basic economics class begins with three things: supply and demand, the factors of production, and the benefits of international trade. Economists expect countries to specialize in industries where they have a comparative advantage versus the rest of the world and trade for the goods they do not produce. In this project, I examined real-world bilateral trade data from the UN Comtrade database, the US International Trade Commission, and the World Bank to see if economies that have different broad-sector breakdowns trade more frequently. After controlling for the gravity trade model, I found that differences between countries in the four sectors ("Industry", "Agriculture", "Services", and "Manufacturing") was *negatively* associated with trade volumes. This contradicts the comparative advantage model, and implies that intra-sector trade dominates trade flows. 

### 3. Aggregate Profits

Firms watch macroeconomic data like GDP and inflation in expectation that it will impact their businesses. However, a firm's revenue and costs might not be directly related to the macro variables that they observe closely, especially for larger public companies. The Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Economic Analysis routinely publish tailored measures of national income, like aggregate profits and revenues of firms in the US, that could be used by managers to make better forecasts for their firms. This project aggregated corporate revenues and profits from roughly 2,000 publicly traded firms and compared those aggregations to these Fed and BEA statistics to see which is a better measure of the wellbeing of corporate America.
