A highlight of my personal and school computer science / data science projects

## My projects

### 1. Monpoly Power (Honors Thesis)

I am currently completing an honors thesis at Washington and Lee University exploring the relationship between a companies risk profiles and monopoly power. This project involved a large panel dataset from the Wharton Research database, coding my own applications for calculating a firm's risk, and extensive econometrics and data visualization. I find that some commonly used measures of monopoly power disagree with each other in a way that is not well explained by current theory. In addition, I further the research on the murky relationship between risk and monopolism. 

### 2. Comparative Advantage

Any basic economics class begins with three things: supply and demand, the factors of production, and the benefits of international trade. Economists expect countries to specialize in industries where they have a comparative advantage versus the rest of the world and trade for the goods they do not produce. In this project, I examined real-world bilateral trade data from the UN Comtrade database, the US International Trade Commission, and the World Bank to see if economies that have different broad-sector breakdowns trade more frequently. After controlling for the gravity trade model, I found that differences between countries in the four sectors ("Industry", "Agriculture", "Services", and "Manufacturing") was *negatively* associated with trade volumes. This contradicts the comparative advantage model, and implies that intra-sector trade dominates trade flows. 

### 3. Immigration and Language Acquisition

With a co-author, I analyzed the past 7 decades of immigration and language acquisition in the United States using the Current Population Survey. We found that recent immigrants arrive in the US with poorer English speaking ability, and this lower ability rarely diminishes. However, recent immigrants learn English at a faster rate than their counterparts in the mid-twentieth century, and Immigrants quickly assimilate to the US through other means, like cultural practices. The paper furthers the applied microeconomic debate on immigration in the US and highlights the positive features of recent immigration.
