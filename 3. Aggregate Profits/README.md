# Wall and Main: Assessing Aggregations of Public Firms and Macroeconomic Accounts

## Summary

In this project, I compare aggregate revenues and profits from large public companies to the Bureau of Economic Analysis' measures of national income. The goal is to provide insight into how national income accounts like GDP correlate with changes in a firm's own revenue and profits. I find that nominal GDP does an excellent job in predicting public firms' revenues, but not at a one-to-one relationship. In fact, it seems that the country's largest firms have the most volatile revenues, and will suffer most during economic slowdowns. In other words, the large publicly traded firms we might think of as cornerstones of our country's output are actually much riskier than the Main Street economy.

Regardless, firm managers and investors can use this simple analysis to consider how macroeconomic conditions will impact their companies.

## Data 

I gathered data from CompustatIQ at the Wharton Research Database. It's largely the same dataset that I use for my thesis. I can't publish the data because it's too big and goes against the Wharton Research Database's terms of Service.

See the report for a better understanding of the analysis. It has some cool graphs!
