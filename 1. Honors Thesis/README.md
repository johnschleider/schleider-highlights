# Systematic Risk and Measures of Monopoly Power

## Abstract

This paper empirically assesses the relationship between systematic risk, measured by CAPM beta, and various measures of monopoly power. I find that the most theoretically sound measure of power, the Lerner index, indicates a negative relationship, but other measures commonly used in the literature imply an inconsistent or positive relationship. The results with the Lerner index confirm most theoretical findings regarding this subject, and, when combined with theory, might suggest the Lerner index is a better measure of monopoly power compared to the Hirshman Herfindahl index, Tobinâ€™s Q, and the price-cost margin. 

## Value

The relationship between the risk investors take on when investing in a firm and the monopoly power of that firm is important for many reasons:

- Firm managers consider the company's power when deciding interactions with their investors, and vice versa
- Investors value firms based on their risk (which they dislike), and a negative relationship would confer additional benefits to monopolies based on their lower risk profiles
- A firm's risk determines its cost of capital, which impacts its investment decisions--if a negative relationship exists, monopolists have lower costs of capital and can better invest and innovate

While the Lerner Index consistently demonstrates a negative relationship, the broader results demonstrate we need further research and theory to identify the best measures of monopoly power.
